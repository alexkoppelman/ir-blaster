# IR - Blaster

Small React app to send and recieve MQTT Messages for the https://github.com/alexkoppelman/ESP32-Infrared-Blaster

The App uses an HTTP endpoint from node-Red to query an SQL database for the last x temperature values
This then generates a chart.

Buttons to switch on/off a heater and raise or lower the temperature that trigger a mqtt message.



## Todo:

Compile Android app for this. First attempt failed.
